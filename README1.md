this class we focused on some of the basic arithmetic operators of javascript. We pair coded in a group of three. We decided that I would be the commander of the group, and the other 2 guys would do all the coding. 

First, I had them clone a repo i created and create a branch. We encountered a few issues and command line issues, I sort of let them get lost and feel frustrated. I think thats important, because it shows them how to slowly climb out of the holes we dig ourselves into. 

One of coders, Luke ran into an issue by cloning into the wrong directory. Shortly after, Apoorv ran into the same issue. So they both learned an important lesson about using git within directories, and also the importance of always being aware of your current location when using the command line. 

By the end of the class, each of them had managed to add or alter a .js file to their branch and push it to the origin repo. After, I showed them the beauty of gitkraken gui by merging their branches to the master with two clicks of the mouse.
