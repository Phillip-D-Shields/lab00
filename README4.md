This week we started on parameters and arguments, and carried on working with functions. For me it was a good refresher, and I picked up a few useful tidbits about using ```.length``` arguments and parameters that will be useful when debugging, or just generally trying to figure out why my code isn't working.

For code pairing we were given 4 tasks, which in my opinion were a bit beyond most of the classes ability. But not completely unreachable. The first example was pretty simple, and Aaron did everything. But the second example was a bit more complex and I struggled with writing it in a way the Aaron could follow, I also found it difficult to concentrate while i knew someone was watching my screen. I kept messing up, even though I had done similar things many times before. I did not like it. Solving and explaining the second example took almost the entire classtime.

Last week, during the break, I did an exercism.io assessment that required me to write a function that accepted 3 parameters, the first 2 were digits and base of digits, and the third parameter was the base that the first digits had to be converted to. I wrote the function to convert any base into base 10, or decimal, because that was the base we are most familiar with. Then I just needed a helper function that would convert the decimal of the first 2 parameters into the base of the third parameter. It took me a couple days, was a rather rough ride. Eventually I got it. So Lab four was already solved for me. I just used the helper function that converted a decimal to any base, modified it to be specific to binary. I think lab four is a good one for the more advanced students, but it will cause big problems for the less experienced in the class.
