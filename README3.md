This week we focused mostly on If statements and switch statements. I had a decent previous knowledge of them, but the practice these last two days has definitely helped cement the fundamentals in my head. 

The most useful practice was writing multi-case switch statements with conditional statements within each case. 

I also figured out that when writing those types of multi-case switch statements, that the switch should rely on boolean values to trigger the content of each scenario. This was the only way I could get my switch statements to successfully console log.
