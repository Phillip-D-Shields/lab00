This week the classes focused on getting our javascript environment setup and ready, as well as some basics of git and github. I have a bit of experience with both already, so I tried to help the other students when possible. 

The environment is crucial to being able to keep a steady workflow, having it setup and ready to go means that we can open up vs code and start without delay. 

Git is an industry standard, and its usefulness needs not be explained here. The most practical way to utilize git is with Github, especially now that NMIT is affiliated with them. 

I think git command line is painful and also powerful. I am skeptical about using it, as i am a more visual learner and seeing the git process via gitkraken helps me to understand where everything is.

The group work with branches was rough, but the practice definitely beneficial for me. We setup a master branch with an index.js file and had everyone add their name to it on their branch, then merge all their names onto the master. We hit a few bumps along the way, but eventually we all got it.
