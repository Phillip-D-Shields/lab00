The main thing we focused on this week was the different equality operators, the various use scenarios, and the odd result scenarios.

It was a good class for me because I still struggle with the proper use case for different equality operators, and often forget about what javascript actually does behind the screen to compute the output. 

I remembered that the double equal sign `==` converts various data types to evaluate an outcome, and that the triple equal sign `===` strictly evaluates without converting to similar data types. 

I plan on reviewing the gitbook material again, because I know that really locking those interactions into my knowledge will improve my javascript effeciency and workflow. 

The class and exercises definitely helped remind me that there is quite a bit of js that I used to know pretty well, but my lack of practical use has let me forget most of it.

I did not get to write and code out all the examples we went over, as I was trying to help those sitting around me. But I got a decent amount pushed to my repo.
